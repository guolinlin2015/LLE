# LLE

My madlab code for Locally Linear Embedding based on algorithm from https://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/lle/algorithm.html
Original code from paper found here https://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/lle/code.html
Note that as of 10/31/17 code found at the above link does not work with the most recent version of matlab.
